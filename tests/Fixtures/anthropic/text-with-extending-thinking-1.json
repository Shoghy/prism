In the book, a supercomputer named Deep Thought was built to calculate \"the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything.\" After 7.5 million years of computation, Deep Thought reveals that the answer is \"42\". However, Deep Thought points out that the answer seems meaningless because the beings who asked it never actually knew what the Ultimate Question was to begin with.\n\nThis \"42\" answer has become a famous cultural reference and joke in popular fiction and geek culture.
