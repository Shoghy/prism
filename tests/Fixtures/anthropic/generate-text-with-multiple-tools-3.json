What time is the Tigers game today?\nThe Tigers game is scheduled for 3:00 PM today in Detroit.\n\n2. Should I wear a coat?\nBased on the weather forecast for Detroit, which shows 75°F (about 24°C) and sunny conditions, you likely won't need a coat. The weather is quite warm and pleasant, so a light jacket or long-sleeved shirt should be sufficient if you tend to get chilly easily. However, if you're planning to stay for an evening game or if the temperature drops, you might want to bring a light jacket just in case.\n\nEnjoy the game and the nice weather!"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":648,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":155,"service_tier":"standard"}}
